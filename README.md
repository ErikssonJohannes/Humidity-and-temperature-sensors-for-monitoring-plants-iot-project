# Humidity-and-temperature-sensors-for-monitoring-plants-iot-project
Project for the course Introduction to Applied IoT, Summer 2022

**Name:** Johannes Eriksson; **Student** credentials: je224bk

# Short project overview
This project is aimed to construct a simple iot device with 2 sensors for placement besides your plant that monitors the temperature and air humidity around the plant aswell as the humidity in the plants soil in order to se when you need to water your plant. 

**Approxiamtion of time needed for the project:**

Around one hour


# Objective
**Reasons for choosing the project:**
The reason i choose this project is that i some plants in my home and have the habit of sometimes forgetting to water them in time before they start to wither so being able to the when i should water the plants will probably help them thrive. 

**Purposes of the project:**
The purpose of this project is firstly to learn about the Inter of things, how to build a iot device and connect it to a platform to visualize its data. And secondly to monitor my plants to see when i need to water them.

**Insights gained by doing the project:**
The project is able to give insights in basic concepts of IOT, programming and electric circuits.
